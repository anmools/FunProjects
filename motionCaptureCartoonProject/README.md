Dear reader,

This motion capture model was drawn through multiple individiual layers using FireAlpaca. After this model was drawn, it was rigged using Live2D Cubism. 

The app used in the example gif is Vtube Studio. When the camera is on, if the user moves their head, blinks or speaks, the model will act accordingly.
